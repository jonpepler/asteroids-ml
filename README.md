# asteroids-ml
*(WIP) A machine learning algorithm that plays Asteroids.*
https://jonpepler.github.io/asteroids-ml/

## development
See the [starter Gatsby readme](https://github.com/jonpepler/asteroids-ml/blob/master/README-Gatsby.md) for info on how to work with this project.

## todo
- [x] Host a PWA using GitHub Pages and Gatsby
- [ ] Make Asteroids clone in p5
- [ ] Use ml5.js to write a machine learning process to learn how to play and save progress in local storage
- [ ] Use something like [this](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver) to turn the PWA into a local screensaver
